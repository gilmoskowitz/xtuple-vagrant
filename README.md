## xTuple and Vagrant

xTuple uses Vagrant to build disposable Linux virtual machines
(VMs).  The files in the
[xtuple-vagrant repository](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant)
simplify spinning up new VMs for several different use cases,
including hosting demonstration databases and developing for the
web API and desktop clients.

See [the xtuple-vagrant wiki](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/wiki#common-instructions) for instructions on setting up your vagrant development environment. Here's a summary of what you'll find there:

1. Install Vagrant
1. Install Git
1. Check out the source code
1. Configure your VM
1. Start and Connect to the VM
1. Start Developing
